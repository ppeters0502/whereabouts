# WhereAbouts - Where u @ fam? 
**Project Idea for CYBR8480 - Secure Mobile Development class at the University of Nebraska Omaha**

# Executive Summary
Google Maps, Waze, Uber, GrubHub, the list of popular location based services continues to grow for smartphone users. The concept of a person or company knowing your exact location in a matter of seconds, a concept that just a decade ago sounded completely foreign to the average user, is now a tried and true business strategy for bringing the services of the internet to your exact location. Need the nearest dry cleaner? Don't panic, your phone can pull up the closest 5 of them at the touch of a touchscreen. Need a ride to the concert? A rideshare driver is already on their way to the exact park bench or street corner you're at right now.

There is a downside to this conveniance though. While your exact location can be used by ridesharing services, food delivery services or any other apps/services that request permission, it can also be tracked by third parties that sign contracts with those apps, looking to track your location habits. Those tracked location habits can lead to targeted ads based off your favorite locations, potential data breaches of your location data getting into the wrong hands, and bad actors knowing your every location from the past 6+ months.

### What do you do?
You don't want your every move tracked by the local pizza guy, and don't want targeted ads filling up every inch of your digital life because you wanted to try a free yoga class once. At the same time though, the conveniance the internet at your exact location is a hard thing to give up cold turkey. The conveniance of letting your wife know you're on your way home from work, or telling your mom that you made it home safely, or telling your friends you're running late, without even picking up your phone sounds good. You want to be in control of who is finding out where you are.

### This is where we come in!

With WhereAbouts, your GPS data is sent to your own private WhereAbouts instance, and customized to fit with how much (or how little) you want tracked.
