# WhereAbouts - Where u @ fam? 
**Project Idea for CYBR8480 - Secure Mobile Development class at the University of Nebraska Omaha**

## Executive Summary
Google Maps, Waze, Uber, GrubHub, the list of popular location based services continues to grow for smartphone users. The concept of a person or company knowing your exact location in a matter of seconds, a concept that just a decade ago sounded completely foreign to the average user, is now a tried and true business strategy for bringing the services of the internet to your exact location. When it comes to location tracking by private individuals though, many more people are less comfortable with that idea, even within the confines of family and close friends
WhereAbouts is an effort to put a friendlier face on location tracking loved ones, by putting the power of where your location data is going in your hands. 

## Project Goals
* Connect to MQTT Broker using TLS secured connection
* Publish location data on MQTT broker through secured connection
* Connect to MQTT broker (Raspberry Pi) through bluetooth to get security certificate and configure user credentials
